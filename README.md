**I strongly discourage using this repository as a basis for your own capacitive PCB project. I make zero claims about the quality of the routing.**

This PCB allows you to modify your Model F XT or Bigfoot to have this layout:

Alt to the left of the spacebar becomes two 1u keys.

Caps Lock to the right of the spacebar becomes two 1u keys.

Enter becomes one 2u vertical keycap - there is no pad on the lower barrel due to the XT's PCB alignment pin.

Two additional keys are added above and below Numpad +. These are optional and the original Numpad + can be kept.
